                      <h2>1969 Vintage Chevrolet Corvette Stingray</h2>
                      <p>
                        Specs:
			The Stingray name (now spelled as one word) appears on the front fenders above four vertical fender vents. 
			The backup lights were integrated into the center tail lights. The fenders are unflared and the front cornering
			 lamps are round. The steering-wheel diameter was trimmed an inch for more under-rim thigh clearance. Interior 
			 door handles and control knobs were redesigned. A warning light was added to warn that the headlights hadn't 
			 completely opened. The ignition is now on the steering column and the door depression button used in 1968 was 
			 eliminated. A key lock was put in it's place. The interior has glove box mounted map pockets but no wood on 
			 the door panels. Front and rear disc brakes, headlight washers, center console, wheel trim rings, carpeting and
			  all vinyl upholstery are standard; the windshield-washer jets were moved to the wiper arms. The frame was 
			  stiffened and standard rim width went up to eight inches. An attempt was also made to improve the Astro 
			  Ventilation flow volume, but the results were far from satisfactory. In 1969 there were 116 cars built 
			  with the L88 engine option. These cars were all to be racers, so they did not have heaters or radios, 
			  and most came with transistor ignition, special heavy duty brakes, special front and rear suspension 
			  and heavy duty close ration 4 speed transmission. The horsepower was 430 hp when it should really have 
			  been 560 hp.
